# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# AI-Summarizer
The modern UI offers intuitive design with AI-powered summary generation from article URLs, saving summaries locally for easy access and quick sharing via clipboard. It utilizes advanced RTK Query API for optimized, conditional requests, emphasizing clean, reusable code architecture.
